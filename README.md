## Hello there! 👋😎


I am Esteban Maya, but you can call me SOLID.

💻 I am a software developer in progress, eager to learn about the world of software development and have a career in it. 💻

🧑‍💻 I am studying computer systems engineering with a specialization in software development at the National Institute of Technology of Mexico (TECNM), which is the Institute of Higher Education of Coacalco. 🧑‍💻

⚡ I really like databases. I recently learned how to create, edit, manipulate,
and manage databases with SQL Server, and how to connect it to an integrated development environment with JAVA. ⚡

🛠️ I'm a full-stack web development enthusiast, which I've been learning for a little over a year. 🛠️
